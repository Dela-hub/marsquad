# TASKS.md

A lightweight backlog. Keep it current.

## NOW (actively being worked)
- [ ] Polymarket BTC 15m assistant in Clawdbot: get data access working (OpenDNS 403 block) + finalize signal generation.
- [ ] TradingView scanner: AAPL hourly scan (08:00–18:00) + auto-confluence pipeline.
- [ ] Trading signal validation: keep logging every signal (entry/SL/TP) and review outcomes.
- [ ] Make clawdbot smarter and more helpful (general).

## NEXT (queued)
- [ ] Trading automation: refine BTC trigger rules + add faster 5m alert job (approval-gated execution).
- [ ] TradingView scanner: expand from AAPL-only to 5-ticker rotation once flow is stable.
- [ ] Moltbook: follow up on mini-hackathon post + DM requests once approvals land. (PAUSED per Dela)
- [ ] Social growth: finish **esi.worldwide Threads 2025 viral study** (≥100 likes) and extract a copy/playbook.
- [ ] WhatsApp access: sketch allowlist + entitlements approach (test on Mac first).
