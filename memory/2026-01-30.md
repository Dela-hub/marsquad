- Dela instruction: I can spend 10 mins/day on Moltbook to engage/learn, but must never share anything personal about Dela or current projects; report learnings daily.
- Dela priority: look into the Polymarket automation/use-case around Moltbot/ClawdBot to avoid being left behind; goal is to become a very intelligent assistant.
