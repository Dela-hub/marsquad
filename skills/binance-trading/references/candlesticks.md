# Candlestick patterns (confirmation only)

Use these as **confirmation at a level** (support/resistance or demand/supply), ideally with **Fib 0.618 confluence** on pullbacks.

Do **not** take trades based on candlesticks alone.

## Bullish confirmations (for longs)

### Bullish engulfing
- A bullish candle whose body fully engulfs the prior bearish candle’s body.
- Best when it happens **after a pullback into support/demand**.

### Hammer
- Small body near the top, long lower wick.
- Signals rejection of lower prices. Best at support.

### Morning star (3-candle reversal)
- Strong bearish candle → small indecision candle → strong bullish candle closing into/above the first candle’s body.
- Best at higher timeframe support.

### Piercing line
- Bearish candle then bullish candle that closes above the midpoint of the prior bearish body.

### Bullish harami
- Small bullish candle contained within the prior bearish candle’s body.
- Weaker than engulfing; prefer with extra confluence.

### Three white soldiers
- Three consecutive strong bullish candles with higher closes.
- Useful as confirmation of reversal/continuation, but can be late (avoid chasing).

## Bearish confirmations (for exits / avoid longs)

### Bearish engulfing
- Bearish candle body fully engulfs prior bullish candle’s body.
- At resistance/supply, this can be a strong “no longs” signal.

### Shooting star
- Small body near the bottom, long upper wick.
- Rejection of higher prices; best at resistance.

### Evening star (3-candle reversal)
- Strong bullish candle → indecision → strong bearish candle closing into/through prior body.

### Dark cloud cover
- Bullish candle then bearish candle that closes below the midpoint of the prior bullish body.

## Quick rules
- Prefer confirmations on **1H or 4H** (less noise) and execute on **15m–1H**.
- For pullback entries: confirmation candle should appear **at/near the level**.
- If the confirmation candle is huge (wide body), risk may be too large → skip.
