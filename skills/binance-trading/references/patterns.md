# Patterns (use only these)

Keep it mechanical. If it isn’t near a level, it isn’t a trade.

## 1) Breakout → Retest
- Mark a clean horizontal level.
- Wait for a breakout close.
- Enter on the retest (limit if possible).
- Stop: beyond the retest swing.
- Target: next major level.

Avoid: buying the first green candle through resistance.

## 2) Rejection wick at a key level
- Price taps a level and prints a long wick (failed push).
- Enter on the next candle confirming direction.
- Stop: beyond wick high/low.

## 3) Range edge
- Only when the range is obvious.
- Buy near range bottom / sell near range top.
- Stop: beyond range.

## 4) Trend pullback continuation
- Trade only with structure.
- Enter after pullback and confirmation.
- Stop: beyond pullback swing.

## “No trade” conditions
- Choppy/no structure.
- Price in the middle of the range.
- Stop distance too large for bankroll/risk.
- Unclear invalidation.
